## ScriptTemplate

This repository serves as an optional template for any projects which contain scripts for the programmable source-control client, Fibre.

You can start a script project from scratch if you wish, but using this project should give you a headstart.

#### 2. Config

Secondly, you should update the information in the [package.json](./package.json). The tags you should update include:
- name
- description
- repository.url
- bugs.url

#### 3. Create some scripts

Scripts can be written in either JavaScript or Typescript, but the latter will generally help users to write scripts with fewer bugs in them.

This project contains 3 script examples, you can use them as a guide for making your own. Further examples can be found in [The Standard Scripts Repository](https://github.com/Fibre-SCM/StandardScripts).
